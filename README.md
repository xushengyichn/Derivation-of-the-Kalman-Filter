# Derivation-of-the-Kalman-Filter
The process on how I learn Kalman Filter
Many literature sources merely present the results of the Kalman Filter derivation while leaving out the actual derivation process. 
However, for beginners learning about the Kalman Filter, understanding the derivation process can provide a clearer grasp of this methodology. 
In my write-up, I have included my derivation process, and similar information can also be found in various comprehensive textbooks.

I want to express my gratitude for the videos available in the following link, as they have been immensely helpful in aiding me to get started with the topic.
